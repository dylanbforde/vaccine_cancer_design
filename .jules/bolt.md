## 2026-02-17 - Pandas Iteration vs Vectorization
**Learning:** `iterrows` in pandas is significantly slower than `apply` or vectorized operations, especially for large datasets (130k rows). Benchmarking showed ~20x speedup.
**Action:** Always prefer `apply` or vectorization when processing DataFrame columns. Avoid `iterrows` loop.
